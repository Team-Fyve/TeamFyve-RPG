# TeamFyve-RPG

### **Author(s):** Jason Whiting and Lucas Johns. 
#### Code inspired by CodeNMore's "NEW Beginner 2D Game Programming" YouTube series.

This game is a tile-based, top-down RPG similar to the Pokemon or Fire Emblem franchises, but written
in Java. Its code was written following CodeNMore's YouTube series, with slight changes made 
along the way to personalize the game. The game's narrative (its characters, locations, events, setting,
and plot) will all be original work, once they are actually implemented. The final version will also 
have original, custom-made sprites or possibly some sprites taken from the public domain. The majority
of the game's custom sprites will be made by either Jason Whiting or Joshua Allen, who is not associated 
with the team directly.

This game is still in its infancy as only the basic groundwork has been laid so far. We do not have
much experience in game-based programming. We are also under some time constraints as this is a project
for a college class. Due to these factors, the game may not be 100% completed for quite some time,
but we will try to add as many features as we can. Our goal is to make a functinoal game, regardless of
how small or simple it may end up being. For us, a small but working game is better than a large and 
non-working game.
